My blog from interning in Oldenburg, Lower Saxony, Germany at OFFIS - Institut für Informatik.

# About 
I worked in the Health Division of OFFIS, programming a n-Back Task in an Eye-Tracking Virtual REality headset using C#/Unity. I used a Brain-Computer Interface (EEG) to record stress levels in lieu of the standard paperwork-heavy assessment - the NASA TLX assessment. Furthermore, I worked using openCV software to assess changes in covnitive load for VR applications through pupil dilation.
